    <h2>Sorry this website is still under progress, but if you wanna know what this is about then it's basically just a website with windows stuff like apps, wallpapers, tips, executables, etc. Also, you'll only see html in here cause css sucks and if you dont't know what im talking about then just keep in mind that this website isn't old just because of how it looks.</h2>
